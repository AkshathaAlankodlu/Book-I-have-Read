    <h2>The Alchemist</h2>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Paulo Coelho</p>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Fiction</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2.9</p>
    <p><strong>Review:</strong>The book keeps repeating the phrase "Soul of the World",which got me irritated.
        Even then i rated it a 2.9 because it wanted to convey the readers :
        1)there is some purpose for everything that happens in our life
        2)never regret you actions if it has helped you gain new experiences
        3)do not go searching for something which is within you.
        I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.
        I regret reading it as a first book in 2025.Now that you know what is has you can completely skip it.</p>

      I also liked how observent Esther was from the beginning.
      Though not a major help from her directly ,it was good to find out that their was someone 
      who saw the truth behind the closed doors even without being said.</p>

      which was what the story is about.So..ok i dont mind i spent time in reading it.  </p>

    <p><strong>Review:</strong>  The concept of multiverse in the book had me thinking what others versions of myself would be like.
      It was an engaging book with building curiosity.Jason was very determined that somehow he has to make it home whatever comes by his way.

      I do feel she made the right decision .Hopefully she got a good verse to live in.</p>

      to find his girlfriend screeching at her from the kitchen. 
      It is a tale of friends who are into eachother but have no idea that they feel same about eachother.</p>
    <p><strong>Review:</strong> Apart from the bond between Nathan and Bree,
       I also liked Bree as a dance trainer.She's so caring towards her students.
       She makes sure each one is heard and doesn't want any of them to repeat the mistakes she made in her past.
      I didnt have the habbit of highlighting or quoting lines while I read books but few lines made me do so while reading this book. </p>

      His decision seems fun until one day when things start getting out of hands. </p>
    <p><strong>Review:</strong> I could finish reading the book within hours .With an interesting plot the book kept me hooked from start to finish.
I personally liked how the author tried to convey young readers that ..there's nothing wrong in doing what excites you but under certain circumstances 
where you try and fail don't hesitate to reach out to people who can help you get out of it.</p>

    <h2> The Last One at the Wedding </h2>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Jason Rekulak </p>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Fiction,Thriller</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.2</p>
    <p><strong>Blurb:</strong> It had been 3 years since  Margeret disappeared from home.
      One evening, Frank receives a call from his daughter Margeret inviting him for her wedding with Aidan whome she met 6 months ago.
    Everything seems fine until Frank receives an image post with Aidan and an unfamiliar face next to him. 
    It is after he finds that the girl in the photo is missing he starts getting suspicious of everything he sees and hears at the wedding venue. </p>
    <p><strong>Review:</strong> Initially I thought it was Frank's daughter who had been kidnapped but as the story went by 
      I was curious to know what was happening and all the reasons behind it.Though at times I didnt like how the story went by,I realised that the author was trying to show 
      how a child who grows without her mother's care ends up in life.Busy in earning for their living Frank could never pay much attention to his daughter,at times when he actually spent time and
      things went wrong he was unable to handle it himself which made the situation hard for the two eventually breaking that father-daughter bond.
      I truly appreciate Frank's decision at the end and was really happy that Frank had Abigal to show all his fatherly love.

      It was after she heard their voice from the hallway that she went out from the back door to avoid this meeting. </p>
    <p><strong>Review:</strong> Having read "Reg flags and rishitas" I had the same vibes reading this book as well. There is similarity in the story.
      Both have the same plot were the charecters fall in love with the person they reject in the arrange marriage setup. </p>

    <p><strong>Review:</strong> The story was suspenseful from the beginning ,which kept me reading till the end.
    Though I didn't like to know who Zara was pregnant with,the overall reading experience was good for me.
    Maybe the author was to trying to show that their are flaws with everyone in one way or the other. 
    All the questions which might arise in the reader will all be answered towards the end of the book making it a book worth reading.

      Having a past of going through the disapperance of her own sister-Lydia, Chelsey takes the case personally and works towards finding the truth behind the case.  </p>
    <p><strong>Review:</strong> The story was disturbing at times when Ellie explains of what she had been through over the last 2 years of her disapperence.
    The main thing that I liked about the book is that it shows how a person who has been running behind materialistic love 
    turn outs to be when she experiences the meaning of actually love and bond that exists around us irrespective of where and whom we are with.   </p>

      2 weeks later Meredith and her daughter Delilah are no where to been seen when Josh returns home one evening after his work.</p>
    <p><strong>Review:</strong> With unpredictable plot twist this was a easy to read thriller.Thought I felt a little off about  the writing while reading the part one of the book,I liked this book. 
      It's after 70% that we know the reason for the missing people.It clearly portrays how mistakes in life can spoil everything about a happy family.
      I feel so sorry for the Dickeys ,even if they were innocent all the while they were the ones who had to suffer the most.
